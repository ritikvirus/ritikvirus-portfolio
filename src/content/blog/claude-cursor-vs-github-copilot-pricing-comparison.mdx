Picking between Cursor and GitHub Copilot isn’t just about model quality. It’s about the workflow each editor enables and the total cost once you’re coding every day. Here’s a straight‑shooting guide.

## The short answer

- Copilot is the safest “just works” add‑on inside VS Code/JetBrains with great inline completions.
- Cursor is an editor built around agentic workflows: chat that edits files, multi‑file plans, and repo‑aware context.
- If you want minimal change: Copilot. If you want AI to actively refactor and orchestrate across files: Cursor.

## Features you’ll actually feel

- Inline code completion: Both are fast and strong. Copilot is extremely consistent. Cursor can feel more assertive.
- Chat + edits: Copilot Chat sits in VS Code; Cursor Chat integrates deeper (apply patches, create files, run plans).
- Repo context: Cursor leans hard on project‑wide reasoning. Copilot can use the active context and chat references.
- Test‑first loops: Both can write tests; Cursor’s “apply and re‑run” is more agent‑like.
- Privacy & control: Enterprises may prefer Copilot’s Microsoft ecosystem integrations and policies.

## Pricing (check sites for latest)

- GitHub Copilot Individual: typically ~$10/month; Business ~$19/month with policy controls and org features.
- Cursor: has a free tier with limits; paid tiers add higher context windows, more actions, and priority models.

Prices and quotas change frequently. Always verify current numbers on the official pricing pages.

## Which should you choose?

- You live in VS Code or JetBrains and want great completions with minimal workflow change → Copilot.
- You want an AI first editor that can plan edits and modify multiple files → Cursor.
- Team rollout with governance → Copilot Business.

## Final thought

Try both for a week on the same project. The “feel” matters more than any single benchmark. Your repo, your tests, your editor muscle memory—those decide the winner.
