If you’ve built with GPT‑3.5/4 for a while, the GPT‑5 lineup can feel like a big step change rather than a simple version bump. Here’s a clear, no‑fluff breakdown you can actually use to pick the right model for your product today.

## TL;DR

- Traditional GPT (3.5/4.x) = fast generalists with limited tool use and reasoning depth.
- GPT‑5 Preview = latest weights and features first, best for prototyping and early adopters. May change.
- GPT‑5 Pro = stable, production‑grade variant with tighter SLAs/quotas and more predictable outputs.
- GPT‑5 “Thinking” = optimized for multi‑step reasoning and tool use; slower but more reliable on complex chains.

Use Preview for exploration, Pro for shipping, and Thinking for hard reasoning problems.

## Traditional GPT vs GPT‑5: what changed

- Reasoning depth: GPT‑5 families are better at planning, decomposing tasks, and maintaining state across steps.
- Tool use: More reliable function/tool calling and longer chains without derailing.
- Context: Larger effective context windows and better recall under long contexts.
- Safety/guardrails: Safer defaults and more consistent policy adherence.
- Latency options: You can pick faster configurations (Preview/Pro) or slower, deliberate variants (Thinking).

## Preview vs Pro vs ‘Thinking’

### GPT‑5 Preview
- Purpose: Access new weights and capabilities early.
- When to use: Demos, spikes, quick PoCs, prompt R&D.
- Trade‑offs: May shift in behavior; quotas and availability can fluctuate.

### GPT‑5 Pro
- Purpose: Stable, production‑ready default.
- When to use: User‑facing features, SLAs, and revenue paths.
- Trade‑offs: Slightly behind Preview on bleeding‑edge features.

### GPT‑5 ‘Thinking’
- Purpose: Multi‑step reasoning and tool orchestration.
- When to use: Agents, planning, data analysis, multi‑hop tasks, code refactors with tests.
- Trade‑offs: Higher latency and cost; benefits appear on complex tasks, not trivial ones.

## Choosing the right one (quick rubric)

- Is it production and user‑facing? → Start with Pro.
- Is it an experiment or internal R&D? → Use Preview.
- Is the task multi‑step, error‑sensitive, or tool‑heavy? → Try Thinking.

## Prompting tips by variant

- Preview: Keep prompts simple and log results; expect drift over weeks.
- Pro: Freeze prompts with test fixtures; monitor regressions across minor model revs.
- Thinking: Provide explicit goals, tools, and constraints; set timeouts; use retries with state resume.

## Cost and limits

Costs, quotas, and availability vary by region and account type. Expect Thinking > Pro > Preview for unit cost and latency. Always confirm the latest pricing on the provider’s dashboard before launch.

## Bottom line

Use GPT‑5 Pro as your default. Reach for Preview to explore new capabilities, and Thinking when correctness across multiple steps matters more than raw speed.
