ComfyUI is a node‑based, visual workflow engine for Stable Diffusion. Instead of juggling command‑line flags or monolithic UIs, you snap nodes together—load a model, feed a prompt, wire up a scheduler, route to an upscaler—and press go. The graph is your recipe.

## A short history

- ComfyUI emerged from the open‑source Stable Diffusion community as a performance‑tuned, modular alternative to heavyweight UIs.
- It grew fast because the graph abstraction made sharing complex pipelines simple: you don’t share screenshots—you share the actual workflow.
- The ecosystem exploded with custom nodes, LoRA tools, ControlNet helpers, upscalers, and automation add‑ons.

Note: Exact launch dates, maintainers, and release numbers change as the project evolves. Always check the official repo for the latest maintainers and releases.

## Why people use ComfyUI

- Precision control: Every step is visible and editable.
- Reproducibility: A workflow file is a portable recipe.
- Extensibility: Drop in custom nodes and models.
- Performance: Efficient graph execution and caching.

## What you need to run it (minimums)

- GPU: 8 GB VRAM is a practical minimum for SD 1.5 workflows; 12 GB+ recommended for SDXL and heavier pipelines. CPU‑only is possible but very slow.
- RAM: 16 GB system memory is comfortable; more for large batch sizes.
- Storage: 20–40 GB for base models, LoRAs, and checkpoints grows quickly.
- OS: Windows, Linux, or macOS; NVIDIA GPUs (CUDA) are the most common path.

## Getting started fast

1. Install Python 3.10+ and Git.
2. Clone the ComfyUI repository and install requirements.
3. Drop your models into the designated folders (checkpoints, VAE, LoRA).
4. Launch the server; open the UI in your browser.
5. Import a starter workflow and press Generate.

## Use cases that shine

- Batch asset generation for games and product shots.
- Consistent style pipelines using LoRA/embeddings.
- Inpainting/upscaling chains with control nodes.
- Automated pipelines on render nodes (local or cloud like RunPod).

## Final notes

ComfyUI rewards tinkering. Start simple, then layer in nodes as you learn. Save and version your graphs—you’ll thank yourself later.
