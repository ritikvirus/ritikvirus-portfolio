## Overview

ThinkDiffusion is a scalable AI inference platform designed for high-quality image generation using Stable Diffusion and ComfyUI. I automated GPU environment provisioning and standardized pipelines for reliable, repeatable deployments.

## My Role & Impact

- Automated GPU infra with Flask + Terraform + Boto3 to cut setup time from hours to minutes.
- Customized Stable Diffusion/ComfyUI pipelines for production reliability and performance.
- Built secure CI/CD and environment isolation to minimize blast radius.
- Implemented observability with Grafana + Prometheus to reduce MTTR by ~40%.

## Security Highlights

- Neutralized an RCE in a ComfyUI plugin via container sandboxing and RBAC.
- Enforced storage quotas (100GB) platform-wide to prevent abuse.
- Patched GPU credit exploit through API validation and policy hardening.

## Tech Stack

AWS (EC2/EKS, IAM, VPC), Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Nginx Ingress, Terraform, Flask, Boto3, Grafana, Prometheus.

## Outcome

Hardened, automated, and observable AI inference platform with reliable performance and zero security incidents.
