## Overview

I migrated and standardized Eggoz services onto AWS EKS with secure-by-default defaults, automated delivery, and cost-aware networking.

## My Role & Impact

- Containerized services with Docker; deployed via Helm to EKS.
- Built CI/CD (Jenkins) with blue/green and rollback safety.
- Integrated Route53, ECR, and VPC with least-privilege IAM.

## Security Highlights

- Removed exposed AWS keys; enforced MFA and credential rotation.
- Added CloudTrail/GuardDuty alerts and Secrets Manager for sensitive config.

## Tech Stack

AWS (EKS, ECR, Route53, VPC, IAM), Docker, Helm, Jenkins, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Secrets Manager.

## Outcome

Reliable, secure delivery with consistent release cadence and improved operational visibility.
