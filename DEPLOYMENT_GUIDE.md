## üîç Troubleshooting Build Errors

### Error: "Module has no exported member"
**Cause:** Environment variables not loaded  
**Solution:** Add all variables to Vercel, redeploy

### Error: "Payment service not configured"
**Cause:** Missing Merchant ID or Salt Key  
**Solution:** Wait for PhonePe support response, add credentials

### Error: "503 Service Unavailable"
**Cause:** This is expected until full credentials are added  
**Solution:** Add all PhonePe credentials, redeploy

### Build Succeeds Locally But Fails on Vercel?
