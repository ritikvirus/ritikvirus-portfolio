## 📞 STEP 2: About PhonePe Merchant ID & Salt Key

### Current Research Findings:

Based on my research, here's what I found about PhonePe API credentials:

#### Option A: You MAY Already Have Everything (Check PhonePe Portal)

**Where to Look in PhonePe Business Portal:**
1. Login to: https://business.phonepe.com
2. Check these sections:
   - **Developer Settings**
   - **API Credentials**
   - **Integration Settings**
   - **Merchant Dashboard**

**What to Look For:**
- Merchant ID (might be listed as "MID" or starts with "M")
- API Key / Secret Key (might be the Salt Key)
- Integration credentials section

#### Option B: PhonePe May Use Different API Now

**Modern PhonePe Integration** might only need:
- ✅ Client ID (you have)
- ✅ Client Secret (you have)
- ❓ Possibly NO separate Merchant ID/Salt Key required

### What to Do:

**1. Check Your PhonePe Portal First:**
- Login and look for ALL credential sections
- Take screenshots of any API/Developer settings
- Look for sections like:
  - "API Keys"
  - "Integration"
  - "Developer Tools"
  - "Credentials"

**2. If You Find Merchant ID & Salt Key:**
Add to Vercel as:
```
PHONEPE_MERCHANT_ID=[your merchant ID]
PHONEPE_SALT_KEY=[your salt key]
PHONEPE_SALT_INDEX=1
PHONEPE_BASE_URL=https://api-preprod.phonepe.com/apis/pg-sandbox
```

**3. If You DON'T Find Them:**
Two possibilities:
- **A)** Modern PhonePe API doesn't need them (Client ID/Secret enough)
- **B)** Need to contact support to request them

## 📧 STEP 3: Email Template for PhonePe Support (ONLY IF NEEDED)

**Send this email to:** merchant.support@phonepe.com

```

**2. Test PhonePe Status Page:**

**3. Try Booking (Test):**
1. Go to: https://aidevops.in/training
2. Fill the form with test data
